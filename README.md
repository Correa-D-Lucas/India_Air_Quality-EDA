# India_Air_Quality-EDA
An initial Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a Kaggle dataset containing data about gases in India (2015 -2020).
##### This dataset extracted from Kaggle's website contains information about air quality in India.
##### The purporse of this analysis is to help decision takers to prevent increasing in diseases caused by air polution. 
##### All the gases and PMs, excepted by NOx, has unit equals to ug/m^3 - microgram per meter cubic. NOx unit is ppb - parts per billion. 
##### 1 ppb = 1 ug/L, 1 L = 0.001 m^3, then 1 ppb = 1000 ug/m^3
